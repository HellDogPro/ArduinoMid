# ArduinoMidVauxhall/Opel Astra G MID display replacement with ArduinoMidThis project is rebuild of on board car computer base on ## Note:_This project is rebuild of on-board computer for Vauxhall/Opel vehicles  created between 2000/2004 with gray(32 pin) MID plug.In this project is used Mega2560 RV3 board.The project sourcecode is based on Internet published information!_* Source code is in "MID" folder* Used libraries are in "libraries" folder [zip them for importing]## Version    _Code is  in development..._## ArduinoMid supported features* Engine RPMs.* Vehicle speed in KMh RPMs.* Display back-light works with dashboard lighting.* Consumption for distance and instance [not tested well]* Trip time and distance.* Speed alarm  City / Highway / Out-City* Average speed braking and engine revolutions.* Outside temperature [needs more tests / TODO inside temperature]* Steering wheel buttons handler.* Support Sony xPlod to vehicles steering wheel media buttons.* Fuel gauge/switch support [analog detection from fuel switch].* Car Inspection menu detects critical level for  Oil, Window washer, Brake ware, voltage [Todo lamps, belt, and other ]* Engine temperature.* Power saving operation [factory Bord. Comp. have energy drain when engine is off ...]* Check menu - based on worked time / distance [Todo]* Brake pedal as button [Todo ]* Resolving driving gears * Sport mode [Todo ... luring ECU signal]* Two fuel lines supported [For benzine & propane-butane ... ]* Stopwatch menu* Drag racing menu [Todo ... Gets best speed / time for 402 maters]* From 0 to 100km [Todo ... Gets acceleration time from 0 to 100 kilometers]* Todo more ...## Menu structure for screen 16x2    -----[Main Menu]-----[Trip Menu]-----[Consumption]-----[Inspection]----------[ Chalanges ]-----    ----------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------    -----[Dashboard]-----[Averages ]-----[Fuel levels]-----[Sensor list]---------[ Stopwatch ]----    ----------|--------------------------------------------------*--------------------|----------    -----[Test Menu]---------------------------------------------*---------------[ Drag Race ]----    -------------------------------------------------------------*--------------------|-----------    -------------------------------------------------------------*---------------[ 0to100km  ]----## Menu structure for screen 240x64    Comming soon ....## Schematics   _Hardware is  in development..._
